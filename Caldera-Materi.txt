### Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Caldera (@Calderaxyz)

This survey note provides a detailed examination of Caldera, a modular blockchain platform associated with the X handle @Calderaxyz, based on available information from official websites, blog posts, social media, and news articles as of July 5, 2025. The analysis aims to cover its origins, technology, ecosystem, funding, and community engagement, offering a holistic view for stakeholders and enthusiasts.

#### Background and Founding
Caldera was founded in March 2022 by Matt Katz and Parker Jou, with Katz serving as co-founder and Jou as the Chief Technology Officer (CTO). The company's inception was driven by the recognition of a catch-22 in the web3 world: developers across verticals like NFTs, DeFi, and gaming wanted to build complex applications but were limited by the overcrowded nature of existing Layer-1 (L1) blockchains like Ethereum. Initially dubbed "Constellation," Caldera aimed to create rollups for scalable web3 games but expanded its focus to address broader dApp infrastructure needs.

According to their blog, "We started the company when we realized developers wanted to build interesting things on the blockchain. We realized people actually want to build more complex things across a bunch of verticals and in order to unlock the full potential of web3, itâ€™s untenable for it to happen on a single blockchain." This vision underscores their commitment to enabling scalable, high-performance applications.

#### Technology and Features
Caldera specializes in building high-performance, customizable, and application-specific Layer-2 (L2) blockchains, known as Caldera Chains. These are optimistic rollups that settle on Ethereum, offering several key technical advantages:

- **Speed**: Capable of processing hundreds of transactions per second with sub-second confirmation times, addressing the slow transaction speeds of L1 blockchains.
- **Customizability**: Features such as address whitelisting, sustainable revenue generation models, and other tailored options allow developers to optimize chains for specific dApp needs.
- **Ethereum Compatibility**: Runs standard Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) smart contract code without modification, ensuring ease of development and deployment for Ethereum developers.

Optimistic rollups assume transactions are valid unless proven otherwise, which enhances throughput and reduces costs compared to L1 processing. This technology is particularly suited for dApps requiring high performance, such as gaming platforms and decentralized finance applications.

#### Ecosystem and Metrics
Caldera's ecosystem is one of the fastest-growing rollup ecosystems on Ethereum, with over 75 Caldera Chains as of 2025. The platform's impact is evidenced by the following metrics:
- Total Value Locked (TVL): Over 1 billion
- Total Transactions: 550 million
- Unique Wallets: 17 million

Notable projects built on Caldera include:
- **ApeChain**: A gaming-focused L3 blockchain launched in partnership with ApeCoin and Horizen Labs, utilizing $APE as its native gas token. It offers high performance, ultra-low fees, and tools like a Bridge Interface and Block Explorer for seamless onboarding.
- **Hychain**: Another project leveraging Caldera's infrastructure, though specific details are less publicly available.
- **B3**: Mentioned in official communications, likely a gaming or DeFi platform.

These projects demonstrate Caldera's versatility across sectors like gaming, AI, and DeFi, with partnerships enhancing its ecosystem. For example, Caldera's collaboration with Injective for the inEVM platform simplified interoperability, and their support for Plume Network focused on real-world asset (RWA) tokenization.

#### Funding and Investor Backing
Caldera has secured significant funding, totaling $24 million as of recent reports. The funding breakdown includes:
- **Seed Funding**: $9 million raised in two rounds led by Sequoia Capital and Dragonfly Capital, with participation from Neo, 1kx, and Ethereal Ventures (reported in February 2023).
- **Series A**: $15 million raised in July 2024, led by Founders Fund, further solidifying investor confidence.

Prominent backers include Lattice Capital, MH Ventures, Zonff Partners, TrueBridge Capital Partners, and others, reflecting strong support from the venture capital community. This financial backing has enabled Caldera to expand its team and develop the Metalayer, an interoperability ecosystem aimed at simplifying cross-chain application launches.
